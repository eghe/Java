  2   - add operations to a structure
  3   - separate the algoritm of the structure on which it operates
  4   - work on the structure without modifying it
  5   - applicable when the structure on which visitor operats does not modify v    ery often. If it modifies often, then the visitor needs to change the visit     function or if a new structure is added, visitor needs to implement new visi    t for the new data type.

 10   Visitor pattern is also called double dispatch because we determine at run    time both the type of visitor and visitable.
